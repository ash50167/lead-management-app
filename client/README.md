## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (Node Package Manager)

// step-1 : go to client directory from lead-management-app

 cd client

// step-2 : install node package manager
